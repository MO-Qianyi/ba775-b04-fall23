### Problem Definition
theLook is a fictitious eCommerce clothing website that has approached our team with some of its toughest challenges. Its departments are facing issues relating to retaining customers and managing inventory. The upper management of theLook would like a deeper insight into the problems being faced in the organization. In our analysis, we will try to answer various questions, such as:
- What demographic segments do our customers belong to? What sort of behaviors do they exhibit?
- What does the inventory turnover rate look like for theLook? Can we uncover why it might be low?
- What products and product categories are most popular on the website? Should theLook prioritize these to try and improve its inventory turnover?
- What are revenue and costs looking like for theLook? Is the high level of inventory causing theLook to run at a loss?
- What does retention rate look like over the past few quarters? Is it improving? Why might it be low?
- How effective are the supply chain and logistics? Could a poor time to delivery be affecting customer satisfaction and retention rates?
- Are there any seasonal trends that we can observe in different countries? Can marketing use this trend analysis to boost sales?
